Relational Graph Convolution Network with Multi Features for Anti-COVID-19 Drugs Discovery using 3CLpro Potential Target.

1. Raw dataset used in this research study can be accessed in "Dataset" folder.
2. Drug and corona virus target SMILES were used for various feature extraction.
3. Consequently, creating graph dataset using drugs and targets SMILES respectively.
4. As for node features, features extracted using drug compound and targets SMILES should be utilized.
5. Example of graph data is provided using node features calculated by Mordred (i.e., mordred_graph_data.pt)
